/*
    It's time to start your programming journey! Following along the same path
as every beginning programmer, you will write your first program. Your goal is
to write a variant of the famous "Hello world" program, to make sure that you
know how to use the tools we provide in this course.

Instead of "Hello world!" you should display the following text:

Hello MOOC!
Warning: In order for the grading tool to recognize your solution as correct,
you must print this text exactly as shown above.

Note
You may submit your solution as many times as you wish. Only your highest score
will be kept.
