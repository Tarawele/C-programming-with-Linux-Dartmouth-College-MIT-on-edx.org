/*
    You now know all about special characters now - in particular, how to print
them to your screen. In this task, you'll get some more practice with these
types of characters.

Your goal is to print Dennis Ritchie's famous quote to the screen just as shown
below. To make this task a bit harder, you are only allowed to use one printf
statement in your entire program. Be sure not to omit anything and not to print
anything extra.

Output:
Dennis Ritchie said:
"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it."
Warning: You need to print everything exactly as shown above, including the
attribution.

Note
You may submit as many solutions as you wish. Only your highest score will be
kept.
